# Veterinary Professional Advocacy Research
## Research on Vet Association Positions on Factory Farming

### AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) - National Level

#### KEY FINDING: AVMA Has Weak, Industry-Friendly Positions

**Sow Housing Policy** (Gestation Crates)
- URL: https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/sow-housing
- Position: NEUTRAL/WEAK - Does NOT call for elimination of gestation crates
- Language: "encourages the use of properly managed and improved housing systems"
- Criteria listed are vague welfare standards, not specific bans
- Includes link to literature review: "Welfare implications of gestation sow housing"
- **Pressure Point**: Policy is open for member comments year-round
- **Weakness**: Acknowledges "welfare advantages and disadvantages with any type of sow housing" - gives cover to crates

**Layer Hen Housing Policy** (Battery Cages)
- URL: https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/layer-hen-housing-systems
- Position: NEUTRAL/WEAK - System-neutral, no condemnation of battery cages
- Language: Generic requirements for "feed, water, light, air quality, space, and sanitation"
- Recommends "third-party-audited welfare program" but doesn't specify cage-free
- **Pressure Point**: Policy open for comments
- **Weakness**: Published comparison document on conventional vs furnished vs cage-free without taking stance

**Animal Welfare Principles** (General)
- URL: https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/avma-animal-welfare-principles
- Very high-level, 8 principles including "minimize fear, pain, stress, and suffering"
- No specific application to intensive confinement
- Useful for framing arguments but doesn't help with specifics

#### AVMA Policy Process
- Policies are reviewed on regular basis
- All policies open for member comments year-round
- "Policies under review" filter available - shows which are up for formal review
- Policy development info: https://www.avma.org/about/bylaws/avma-policy-start-finish
- Members can submit comments: https://ebusiness.avma.org/misc/policycommenting.aspx

#### AVMA Structure to Research Further:
- Animal Welfare Committee (likely exists - need to find members)
- Food Supply Veterinary Medicine Coalition
- Student AVMA (SAVMA) - potentially more progressive
- AVMA PAC (Political Action Committee) - shows political priorities

### State Veterinary Medical Boards

**Status**: Need to research individual state boards
**Key States to Prioritize**:
- California (Prop 12 leader, progressive)
- Massachusetts (strong animal welfare laws)
- Michigan (egg-producing state)
- Iowa (major pork producer - hostile territory but high impact)
- North Carolina (major pork, poultry)
- Arkansas (Tyson headquarters)

### Specialist Veterinary Organizations

**Organizations Identified**:
1. American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV)
   - Has antimicrobial guidelines endorsed by AVMA
   - Likely pro-industry on housing

2. American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP)
   - Referenced in AVMA policies
   
3. American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP)
   - Less relevant to factory farming

4. American Association of Avian Pathologists (AAAP)
   - Poultry-focused, likely relevant

**Need to Research**:
- Each organization's housing/welfare positions
- Leadership and committee structure
- Whether they have welfare committees
- Member directories (for targeting)

### International Comparison (for leverage)

**Need to Research**:
- British Veterinary Association positions
- European veterinary associations
- Canadian Veterinary Medical Association
- Australian Veterinary Association

These may have stronger positions that can be used to embarrass AVMA.

### Academic Veterinary Community

**Veterinary Schools to Research**:
- Cornell (strong welfare program)
- UC Davis (California, progressive)
- Tufts (Cummings School, animal welfare focus)
- North Carolina State (in factory farming territory)

**Faculty to Identify**:
- Welfare specialists
- Those who've published critiques of confinement
- Progressive voices who could be amplified

### Strategy Recommendations

#### 1. AVMA Member Pressure Campaign
**Target**: Get progressive vets to flood comment sections
**Mechanism**: 
- AVMA policies open for year-round comment
- Formal review periods are high-impact windows
- Comments from veterinarians carry more weight than public
- Student vets (SAVMA) may be more progressive

**Tactics**:
- Identify which policies are "under review" now
- Coordinate comment campaigns during review periods
- Provide template language citing scientific literature
- Highlight European vet association positions

#### 2. State Board Campaigns
**Target**: Get state boards to adopt stronger positions than AVMA
**Mechanism**:
- State boards set professional standards
- Can be more responsive to public pressure
- Create precedent that pressures AVMA

**Priority States**:
- Start with California (most likely to succeed)
- Use CA success to pressure other states

#### 3. Specialist Society Pressure
**Target**: Get welfare specialists to publicly break with AVMA
**Mechanism**:
- Identify animal welfare-focused vet groups
- Encourage position statements condemning extreme confinement
- Create wedge between welfare vets and production vets

#### 4. Academic Veterinary Voice
**Target**: Get vet schools to take institutional positions
**Mechanism**:
- Faculty can publish op-eds, statements
- Student groups can pass resolutions
- Creates generational pressure (future vets)

#### 5. Media/Reputation Pressure
**Target**: Make AVMA's weak positions embarrassing
**Tactics**:
- "America's vets won't condemn gestation crates"
- Contrast with European vet associations
- Highlight individual vets who disagree
- Create #VetsAgainstCages movement

### Specific Targets for Vet Professional Pressure

#### AVMA Committees to Identify & Pressure:
1. **Animal Welfare Committee** - Primary target
   - Members will have email addresses
   - Can be contacted individually
   - May have internal disagreements

2. **Food Supply Veterinary Medicine Coalition**
   - Interface with industry
   - Potential for conflicts of interest to expose

3. **AVMA House of Delegates**
   - Representatives from each state
   - Vote on policy changes
   - State-level pressure can influence delegates

4. **AVMA Board of Directors**
   - Ultimate decision-makers
   - Public figures who can be called out
   - Professional reputation at stake

#### Key Specialist Vet Groups by Species:

**Swine**:
- American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV)
- Likely most pro-industry (economically tied to pork producers)
- Hardest to move, but highest impact if shifted

**Poultry**:
- American Association of Avian Pathologists (AAAP)
- Poultry Science Association (has vet members)
- United Egg Producers (industry, not vet org)

**Welfare-Focused Groups** (Natural Allies):
- American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB)
- Veterinarians for Animal Welfare (if exists)
- Vet faculty at welfare-focused programs

#### Individual Veterinarian Targets:

**Pro-Welfare Vets to Amplify**:
- Temple Grandin (not a vet but works with vets)
- Research faculty at Cornell, UC Davis, Tufts welfare programs
- Vets who left production medicine citing welfare concerns
- Large animal vets who've spoken out

**Industry Vets to Pressure**:
- Chief veterinarians at Tyson, JBS, Cargill, Smithfield
- These are licensed professionals subject to ethics codes
- Can file ethics complaints with state boards if practices violate welfare

#### State Veterinary Medical Boards - Contact Information Needed:

**Priority States for Campaign**:
1. **California** - Most progressive, Prop 12 precedent
   - California Veterinary Medical Board
   - Large animal welfare advocacy community
   
2. **Massachusetts** - Progressive Northeast
   - Massachusetts Board of Registration in Veterinary Medicine
   
3. **New York** - Large population, progressive
   - NY State Board of Veterinary Medicine
   
4. **Oregon/Washington** - West Coast progressive
   
5. **North Carolina** - Factory farming center (hostile but strategic)
   - Could expose industry conflicts of interest
   
6. **Iowa** - Pork capital (hostile but high impact)
   - Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine
   
7. **Arkansas** - Tyson headquarters
   - Arkansas State Board of Veterinary Medicine

### Next Research Steps

1. ✅ AVMA position documents (COMPLETE)
2. ⬜ Identify policies currently under review at AVMA
3. ⬜ Get AVMA Animal Welfare Committee member names/emails
4. ⬜ Research state vet boards (start with CA, MA, NC, IA) - get meeting schedules, public comment procedures
5. ⬜ Map specialist veterinary organizations - membership numbers, leadership
6. ⬜ Identify progressive vet faculty/influencers - build contact list
7. ⬜ Compare international vet association positions (UK, EU, Canada, Australia)
8. ⬜ Research SAVMA (student vet) positions/activism - student chapters at each vet school
9. ⬜ Identify vets who've publicly criticized confinement - interviews, op-eds, papers
10. ⬜ Find chief veterinarians at major factory farming companies
11. ⬜ Research vet ethics complaint procedures in key states

### Key Insights

**AVMA is Vulnerable Because**:
- Positions are openly weak/neutral
- Policies are open for member comment
- Student vets likely more progressive
- International comparison will embarrass them
- Individual members may disagree
- Welfare specialists exist within the profession

**Pressure Strategy Should**:
- Work through members (more legitimate than external pressure)
- Highlight generational divide (students vs old guard)
- Use international comparison
- Create "progressive vet" identity/movement
- Target state boards for quick wins
- Make weak positions embarrassing via media

**Infrastructure Needed**:
- Database of progressive vets willing to comment
- Template comment language (scientific, professional tone)
- Monitoring of policy review schedules
- Media contacts for vet-focused outlets
- Coordination with existing animal advocacy orgs

### Veterinary Professional Pressure Campaign - Strategic Framework

#### Campaign Goal
Force AVMA and state vet boards to adopt explicit positions against battery cages and gestation crates, creating professional/ethical pressure on corporations to phase them out.

#### Theory of Change
1. **Expose Weakness**: AVMA's neutral positions are indefensible scientifically
2. **Internal Pressure**: Progressive members pressure from within
3. **Generational Divide**: Student vets vs. old guard creates momentum
4. **State Precedent**: Win at state boards, pressure national org
5. **Reputation Damage**: Make weak positions embarrassing professionally
6. **Corporate Leverage**: Vet positions used to pressure restaurant chains

#### Three-Track Strategy

**Track 1: AVMA Member Pressure (Insider)**
- Recruit progressive veterinarians to submit policy comments
- Coordinate comment campaigns during formal review periods
- Support SAVMA (student) chapters passing resolutions
- Identify and amplify dissenting Animal Welfare Committee members
- Create "Veterinarians for Farm Animal Welfare" coalition

**Track 2: State Board Campaigns (Quick Wins)**
- Target California Veterinary Medical Board first (most likely to move)
- Attend public meetings, submit formal comments
- Get veterinarians licensed in state to petition board
- Once CA moves, use as precedent for MA, NY, OR, WA
- Build momentum from blue states to pressure AVMA nationally

**Track 3: Public Pressure (Outsider)**
- Media coverage: "Why won't American vets condemn cruelty?"
- Social media: #VetsAgainstCages, #VetsSpeakUp
- Op-eds from progressive vets in trade publications
- Contrast with European vet associations
- Expose industry ties/conflicts of interest

#### Tactical Toolkit

**For Member Campaigns**:
- Template comment language (scientific, professional tone)
- Literature citations on confinement welfare issues
- Examples from European/international vet associations
- Talking points on professional ethics obligations

**For State Board Campaigns**:
- Model resolution language for state boards
- Public comment sign-up monitoring
- Packets for veterinarians to present at meetings
- Media coverage of board meetings

**For Public Pressure**:
- Press releases highlighting weak positions
- Social media graphics comparing AVMA to EU vets
- Vet testimonials on video
- Protests at AVMA annual conference

#### Integration with Restaurant Chain Campaign

**How Vet Positions Support Corporate Pressure**:
1. McDonald's/Subway cite "industry standards" - challenge the standards
2. Use vet positions in shareholder resolutions
3. Cite vet opposition in media campaigns against chains
4. "Even veterinarians say this is cruel" messaging

**Sequence**:
1. Build vet opposition evidence (state boards, individual vets, student groups)
2. Use in pressure on restaurants: "Professional consensus says this is unacceptable"
3. When restaurants commit, use to pressure AVMA: "Industry is moving, why aren't you?"

#### Measurable Milestones

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Research & Recruitment**
- ✅ AVMA position documents analyzed
- ⬜ 50+ progressive vets recruited to coalition
- ⬜ 10+ vet schools with student groups engaged
- ⬜ State board procedures mapped for 10 states
- ⬜ International vet association positions documented

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6): First Campaigns**
- ⬜ California Vet Board petition filed
- ⬜ 500+ comments submitted on AVMA policies under review
- ⬜ 5+ SAVMA chapters pass resolutions
- ⬜ First media coverage in vet trade press

**Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Escalation**
- ⬜ At least one state board adopts stronger position
- ⬜ Public campaign against AVMA weak positions
- ⬜ Veterinarian testimony used in restaurant campaigns
- ⬜ AVMA forced to respond/defend positions

**Success Metrics**:
- Number of veterinarians in coalition
- Number of policy comments submitted
- State boards with stronger positions
- Media mentions of vet professional divide
- Restaurant chains citing vet positions in commitments

#### Risk Mitigation

**Risks**:
1. **Industry Backlash**: Production vets may resist, cite economic concerns
   - *Mitigation*: Frame as long-term sustainability, cite European success
   
2. **AVMA Resistance**: May dig in rather than change
   - *Mitigation*: State boards and public pressure create costs of resistance
   
3. **Coalition Fracture**: Vets may disagree on tactics
   - *Mitigation*: Clear goals, respect professional tone, science-based arguments
   
4. **Limited Vet Engagement**: May be hard to recruit
   - *Mitigation*: Start with welfare specialists, build credibility, then expand

#### Success Conditions

**What Makes This Winnable**:
1. Science clearly supports confinement welfare concerns
2. AVMA positions are obviously weak (room to move)
3. Generational shift (young vets more progressive)
4. European vet associations provide model
5. Professional ethics codes require consideration of animal welfare
6. Student vets have less industry capture
7. State boards are more accessible than national organization

**Key Leverage Points**:
1. Professional reputation/embarrassment
2. Ethical obligations under vet code
3. Scientific consensus on welfare
4. Student/generational pressure
5. International comparison
6. Individual member voting power in AVMA
