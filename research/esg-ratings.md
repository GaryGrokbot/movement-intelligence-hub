# ESG Ratings & Animal Welfare: Research & Strategic Framework

**Research Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Purpose:** Build strategy to make animal welfare material to ESG ratings

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ESG rating agencies (MSCI, Sustainalytics, ISS) currently treat animal welfare as **under-weighted or absent** in their methodologies. Meanwhile, **FAIRR Initiative** has built a $90 trillion investor network specifically focused on animal agriculture risks—demonstrating institutional demand exists, but hasn't yet translated into rating agency action.

**The gap:** Rating agencies focus on "financially material" ESG issues. Animal welfare is currently framed as ethical/reputational, not financial.

**The strategy:** Make animal welfare financially material through three leverage points:
1. **Investor pressure on rating agencies** (methodology influence)
2. **Regulatory momentum** (CSRD, SEC climate rules creating precedent)
3. **Financial risk evidence** (supply chain, regulatory, reputational materiality)

---

## RATING AGENCY LANDSCAPE

### 1. MSCI ESG Ratings
**Coverage:** 10,000+ companies  
**Methodology:** Industry-specific material ESG issues  
**Animal Welfare Status:** Not explicitly listed as material issue for most sectors

**Key Features:**
- Uses AI and alternative data for ESG ratings
- Focus on "financially relevant sustainability risks"
- Measures company resilience to long-term ESG risks
- Rating influences $13+ trillion in indexed assets

**Influence Points:**
- Methodology consultation periods
- Stakeholder engagement programs
- Research publications setting precedent

### 2. Sustainalytics (Morningstar)
**Coverage:** 16,000+ companies  
**Methodology:** Material ESG Issues (MEIs) framework with 20+ industry-specific risks tracked via 200+ indicators and 1,800+ data points

**Key Features:**
- Two-dimensional: Exposure + Management
- Five risk levels: Negligible → Severe
- Explicit "Material ESG Issues" (MEIs) concept
- Used by PRI signatories, asset owners, banks

**Current Animal Welfare Treatment:**
- Not listed as standalone MEI for most sectors
- May appear under "Product Quality & Safety" or "Stakeholder Opposition"
- Controversies can impact management score

**Influence Points:**
- MEI designation process (this is the key lever)
- Industry subclass methodology reviews
- Stakeholder consultation on materiality frameworks

### 3. ISS ESG (Institutional Shareholder Services)
**Coverage:** Corporate ratings, sustainability bonds  
**Methodology:** Less transparent from public sources

**Key Features:**
- Strong proxy voting influence (governance focus)
- Sustainability Gateway platform
- Biodiversity Impact Assessment Tool (relevant precedent)
- Climate-focused products

**Influence Points:**
- Policy formulation process

## THE PRECEDENT: FAIRR INITIATIVE

**What FAIRR Has Achieved:**
- $90 trillion AUM investor network (400+ members)
- Coller FAIRR Protein Producer Index: 60 largest meat/dairy/aquaculture companies
- 10 material risk themes aligned with SDGs
- 48% company response rate (up from 27% in 2018)
- Active engagements with 57 companies (2023)
- **25% of companies participated in investor dialogues**

**Key Insight:** FAIRR has proven institutional investor demand for animal agriculture risk data. But this hasn't translated to rating agency adoption.

**Why the Gap?**
1. FAIRR focuses on **specialist investors** who seek this data
2. Rating agencies serve **broad market** and weight by "universal materiality"
3. Animal welfare not yet recognized as financially material by rating agencies
4. Rating agencies respond to **regulatory requirements** and **investor demand at scale**

**FAIRR's Engagement Model:**
- Formal letters signed by investor coalitions
- Dialogue meetings with company management
- Progress measurement via primary/secondary data
- Public reporting on company performance

**FAIRR Members Include:** Pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers globally

## CURRENT STATE: HOW ANIMAL WELFARE IS SCORED

### Where It Appears (Weakly):
1. **Controversies/Incidents:** Reactive scoring when animal welfare violations become public
2. **Supply Chain Management:** Indirect treatment under sourcing practices
3. **Product Safety/Quality:** Sometimes bundled with food safety
4. **Stakeholder Opposition:** Reputational risk category
5. **Regulatory Risk:** Only when laws exist (EU welfare standards, California Prop 12)

### Where It's Missing:
- **Not a standalone Material ESG Issue** for restaurant/food retail sectors
- **Not weighted in climate/environmental scores** despite methane/emissions links
- **Not in governance frameworks** despite board oversight importance
- **Minimal data requirements** for companies to disclose

---

## MATERIALITY ARGUMENT: WHY ANIMAL WELFARE IS FINANCIAL

### 1. Supply Chain Risk
- **Cage-free egg transitions:** Multi-year, multi-billion dollar commitments by retailers
- **Gestation crate bans:** CA Prop 12 disrupted pork supply chains nationwide
- **Antibiotics resistance:** FDA/WHO pressure on prophylactic use
- **Disease outbreaks:** Avian flu, swine fever = massive financial losses

### 2. Regulatory Risk (Accelerating)
- **EU:** Animal welfare in CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)
- **US State Laws:** CA Prop 12 (pork), MA Question 3 (eggs, veal, pork)
- **UK:** Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022
- **Investor Disclosure:** SEC climate rules precedent for mandatory ESG disclosure

### 3. Reputational & Brand Risk
- **Undercover investigations** → immediate brand damage (Tyson, Perdue, McDonald's suppliers)
- **Consumer preference shifts:** Plant-based, cage-free, higher welfare premiums
- **Social media amplification:** Viral animal cruelty videos = stock price impacts

### 4. Operational Efficiency
- **Higher welfare = lower mortality** in many cases
- **Better working conditions correlation:** Worker safety and animal welfare linked
- **Antibiotic reduction = biosecurity improvement**

### 5. Investor Stewardship
- **FAIRR's $90T network** proves fiduciary interest
- **Shareholder resolutions** on animal welfare increasing
- **Engagement dialogues** with 57 companies in 2023

## MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### To Rating Agencies:
**Frame:** "You're missing a material risk that $90T in investors are tracking"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Investor Demand:** FAIRR's 400+ members prove institutional interest
2. **Financial Materiality:** Regulatory risk (Prop 12), supply chain costs, reputational damage
3. **Data Availability:** FAIRR Index + expanded frameworks ready to integrate
4. **Competitive Advantage:** First mover gets market share from welfare-focused investors
5. **Regulatory Momentum:** EU CSRD, US state laws → disclosure mandates coming

**Avoid:**
- Moral arguments (rating agencies are amoral - focus on finance)
- Comparing to climate (animal welfare is distinct, not derivative)
- Criticizing existing methodologies (collaborative tone)

### To Investors:
**Frame:** "Animal welfare is a financially material risk absent from your ESG tools"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Portfolio Risk:** Your food/ag holdings have unmonitored welfare exposure
2. **Regulatory Blindspot:** Prop 12-style disruptions not captured in ratings
3. **Fiduciary Duty:** Material risk = fiduciary obligation to monitor
4. **Collective Action:** Your voice + FAIRR network = rating agency change
5. **Competitive Returns:** Higher welfare correlates with operational efficiency

### To Companies:
**Frame:** "Proactive disclosure improves your ESG rating and investor access"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Rating Upside:** Early adopters positioned favorably when agencies add animal welfare
2. **Investor Relations:** FAIRR members managing $90T want this data
3. **Regulatory Preparation:** Ahead of EU CSRD and state-level mandates
4. **Risk Management:** Transparent disclosure = better risk mitigation signal
5. **Brand Value:** Welfare leadership = premium valuation

### To Regulators:
**Frame:** "Animal welfare meets materiality threshold for mandatory disclosure"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Investor Demand:** $90T coalition requesting this information
2. **Financial Impact:** Quantifiable supply chain, regulatory, reputational costs
3. **Market Failure:** Voluntary disclosure insufficient - asymmetric information
4. **International Precedent:** EU CSRD includes animal welfare
5. **Sectoral Relevance:** Material to food, ag, restaurant, retail sectors

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: "Animal welfare is not financially material"
**Counter:**
- Quantified evidence: Prop 12 costs, controversy impacts, regulatory trends
- Investor demand: $90T coalition = fiduciary materiality
- Precedent: Climate was "not material" until it was

**Mitigation:**
- Lead with financial research, not ethics
- Sector-specific materiality (focus on food/ag first)
- Regulatory angle (material = legally required disclosure)

### Risk 2: Rating agencies ignore investor demand
**Counter:**
- Competitive pressure (first mover advantage)
- Client retention (FAIRR members may prefer welfare-inclusive ratings)
- Reputational risk (media coverage of "ESG blind spot")

**Mitigation:**
- Escalate to rating agency boards/shareholders
- Public campaigns highlighting gap
- Support alternative rating providers (FAIRR as competitor)

### Risk 3: Companies refuse to disclose
**Counter:**
- Regulatory mandates (EU CSRD forces disclosure)
- Investor pressure (shareholder resolutions)
- Competitive disadvantage (non-disclosers get poor assumed scores)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with voluntary leaders (best-in-class)
- Provide turnkey disclosure tools
- Negative screens for non-disclosure

### Risk 4: Data quality/comparability issues
**Counter:**
- Standardized frameworks (FAIRR Index model)
- Third-party verification (certifications like GAP)
- Phased approach (start with simple metrics)

**Mitigation:**
- Invest in data infrastructure (Open Paws role)
- Auditable metrics (% cage-free is binary)
- Industry working groups on definitions

### Risk 5: Stakeholder fragmentation
**Counter:**
- FAIRR as central coordinator
- Clear messaging framework (financial materiality)
- Coalition governance structure

**Mitigation:**
- Regular stakeholder alignment meetings
- Shared objectives document

---

## CONCLUSION

**The Opportunity:**
ESG rating agencies control information flows to $13+ trillion in indexed assets. Animal welfare is currently invisible in these ratings despite:
- $90T investor network tracking it (FAIRR)
- Clear financial materiality (regulatory, supply chain, reputational risk)
- Growing disclosure mandates (EU CSRD, US state laws)

**The Strategy:**
Three-pronged approach:
1. **Evidence:** Financial materiality research + data infrastructure
2. **Demand:** Investor coalition leveraging FAIRR's $90T network
3. **Integration:** Formal engagement with rating agencies + regulatory mandates

**The Timeline:**
- **0-6 months:** Build evidence base + investor coalition
- **6-18 months:** Rating agency engagement + methodology consultations
- **18-36 months:** First agency adoption + regulatory mandates + market infrastructure

**The Impact:**
If successful, animal welfare becomes a standard ESG metric for food/ag/restaurant sectors, influencing:
- Capital allocation ($13T+ in ESG-indexed funds)
- Corporate disclosure (mandatory reporting by 200+ companies)
- Supply chain practices (welfare metrics tied to ratings tied to cost of capital)
- Regulatory momentum (investor demand accelerates government action)

**The Multiplier:**
This is infrastructure-level change. Unlike campaigning against individual companies, shifting rating agency methodologies affects every publicly traded company in the sector simultaneously. It's the kind of systemic leverage Open Paws' MEL framework prioritizes.

**Confidence Level:** High (70%+)
- Precedent exists (climate integration into ESG ratings)
- Investor demand proven (FAIRR's growth)
- Regulatory momentum building (EU CSRD)
- Financial materiality demonstrable (Prop 12, controversies)
- Rating agencies respond to market forces (competitive + client demand)

**Key Uncertainty:** Timeline. Could be 18 months or 5 years depending on regulatory pace and investor commitment.
