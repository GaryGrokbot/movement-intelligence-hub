# Walmart Supply Chain Pressure Potential - Research Report

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Value**: Walmart is the world's largest food retailer and commands massive supply chain leverage. As the ASPCA notes: "The grocery industry has the power to prevent billions of farm animals each year from the worst forms of suffering and cruelty." If Walmart demands higher animal welfare standards, suppliers globally must comply or lose access to the largest retail market.

**Current Score**: D grade (221/900 points) - ASPCA Supermarket Scorecard 2024
**Status**: Walmart lags far behind competitors. They have zero animal welfare policies and zero progress reporting on chickens or pigs. Only minimal cage-free egg commitments exist.

---

## 1. CURRENT WALMART ANIMAL WELFARE POSITION

### A. Cage-Free Eggs (Partial Progress Only)
**Policy Score**: 100/100 (has complete policy)
**Progress Score**: 21.75/100 (minimal implementation)
**Store Brand Score**: 75/100 (some cage-free options exist)

- **Policy**: 100% cage-free shell eggs commitment exists
- **Reality**: Only ~21.75% progress reported toward full implementation
- **Store Brands**: Walmart-branded eggs include SOME cage-free options, but not all
- **Sam's Club**: Better performance - fully cage-free store brand eggs

**Gap**: Policy exists but implementation is glacially slow. No clear deadline enforcement.

### B. Chicken Welfare (ZERO Progress)
**Policy Score**: 0/100
**Progress Score**: 0/100  
**Store Brand Score**: 0/100

- **NO Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) policy**
- **NO healthier breed commitments**
- **NO housing standard improvements** (space, lighting, enrichment)
- **NO humane slaughter standards** (controlled atmosphere stunning)
- **NO third-party auditing**
- **NO progress reporting**

**What BCC Requires**:
1. Maximum stocking density 6.0 lbs/sq ft (no cages)
2. Improved environment: friable litter, 8hrs light (≥50 lux), 6hrs darkness, enrichments
3. Controlled-atmosphere processing (avoids live shackling)
4. Third-party auditing + annual public reporting
5. **BCC-approved breeds** (Hubbard JA787, Aviagen Ranger varieties, Cobb-Sasso 200, etc.) that demonstrate higher welfare outcomes

**Gap**: Walmart sells billions of pounds of chicken annually with ZERO animal welfare standards. Fast-growing breeds suffer leg deformities, heart attacks, and inability to perform natural behaviors.

### C. Pork/Gestation Crates (ZERO Progress)
**Policy Score**: 25/100 (minimal acknowledgment)
**Progress Score**: 0/100
**Store Brand Score**: 0/100

- **NO gestation crate-free commitment**
- **NO group housing policy**
- **NO progress reporting**
- **NO crate-free store brand pork**

**Gap**: Pregnant pigs spend their lives in crates so small they cannot turn around. Walmart has no policy to end this despite competitor progress.

---

## 2. COMPETITOR COMPARISON (Walmart is FALLING BEHIND)

### Top Performers:
- **Whole Foods Market**: 761/900 (A grade)
  - BCC-certified chicken available (Better Chicken Project Pasture-Raised)
  - 100% cage-free eggs across all store brands
  - 100% crate-free pork (GAP-certified)
  - Transparent progress reporting

- **Sprouts Farmers Market**: 494/900 (B grade)
  - First to report breed progress
  - Complete cage-free egg policy + implementation
  - Some BCC progress

- **Costco**: 375/900 (C grade)
  - 100% cage-free store brand eggs
  - Some chicken welfare elements addressed

### Walmart's Peers:
- **Target**: 258/900 (D grade) - Similar poor performance
- **Kroger**: 321/900 (C grade) - Ahead of Walmart on chickens
- **Albertsons/Safeway**: 320/900 (C grade) - Better on multiple issues

### Bottom Tier (Walmart's Company):
- **Trader Joe's**: 150/900 (D grade) - Zero policies despite progressive brand image
- **Piggly Wiggly**: 0/900 (F grade) - No cage-free eggs available at all
- **Save A Lot**: 25/900 (F grade)

**Key Finding**: Walmart scored 221/900 in 2024, putting them firmly in the D tier. They're performing worse than Kroger, Costco, and many regional chains.

---

## 3. SUPPLY CHAIN LEVERAGE POTENTIAL

### A. Market Dominance
- **10,500+ stores worldwide** (4,600+ in US)
- **Revenue**: $648 billion (FY2025)
- **Market share**: 25%+ of US grocery market
- **Supplier dependence**: Major suppliers (Tyson, JBS, Cargill, Cal-Maine Foods, Hormel) derive 10-30% of revenue from Walmart

### B. "Walmart Effect" on Supply Chains
When Walmart changes policy, the entire industry must adapt:

**Historical Precedent**:
- **Sustainability**: Walmart's Project Gigaton (reduce 1 billion tons CO2 by 2030) forced thousands of suppliers to report emissions and change practices
- **Seafood**: Walmart sustainable seafood commitments reshaped global fishing practices
- **Palm oil**: Deforestation-free commitments moved Unilever, P&G, and others

**Animal Welfare Potential**:
If Walmart commits to:
- **Cage-free eggs by 2026**: Would force every major egg producer to convert facilities
- **Better Chicken Commitment by 2030**: Tyson, Perdue, Pilgrim's Pride would need to switch to slower-growing breeds, improve housing, change slaughter methods
- **Gestation crate-free pork by 2028**: Smithfield, Hormel, JBS would need to rebuild sow housing

### C. Private Label Power
- **Great Value** (Walmart's store brand): Top-selling grocery brand in America
- **Sam's Club Member's Mark**: Major private label
- **Marketside, Freshness Guaranteed, etc.**: Walmart controls these supply chains directly

**Opportunity**: Walmart could immediately implement BCC standards for private label products (representing 25%+ of sales), proving feasibility and creating competitive pressure.

---

## 4. KEY DECISION-MAKERS

### A. Executive Leadership (as of Feb 2026)

**1. John Furner**
- **Title**: President & CEO, Walmart Inc. (as of Feb 1, 2026)
- **Background**: Started as hourly associate in 1993; led Walmart U.S. (2019-2026)
- **Priorities**: Omnichannel retail, tech integration, associate engagement
- **Leverage Point**: Reputation as innovator who "delivered strong performance" and improved customer experience - animal welfare could be positioned as customer-demanded innovation

**2. John Laney**  
- **Title**: Executive Vice President, Food, Walmart U.S.
- **Responsibility**: Direct oversight of Fresh, Packaged Goods, Private Brands, Snacks, Beverages
- **Background**: 15+ years at Walmart, passionate about "solutions for the customer and building strong relationships with supplier partners"
- **Personal**: Active in foster care advocacy (8 children, 3 adopted from foster care - suggests values alignment potential)
- **Leverage Point**: PRIMARY TARGET - directly controls food sourcing decisions

**3. Latriece Watkins**
- **Title**: Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising Officer, Walmart U.S.
- **Relevance**: Overall merchandising strategy
- **Leverage Point**: Brand reputation, competitive positioning

**4. Doug McMillon** (Retired CEO, still Board Member through June 2026)
- **Legacy**: Launched Project Gigaton (environmental sustainability)
- **Influence**: Remains advisor through Jan 2027
- **Leverage Point**: Legacy-building - sustainability leader who ignored animal welfare?

### B. Board Pressure Points
- **Investor Relations**: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investors increasingly demand animal welfare metrics
- **Shareholder proposals**: Resolutions on factory farming risks, antibiotic resistance, pandemic prevention
- **Reputation risk**: Consumer surveys show 75%+ Americans want higher farm animal welfare standards

---

## 5. PRESSURE TACTICS (Based on Proven Strategies)

### A. Investor Pressure (Most Effective for Walmart)
**Why It Works**: Walmart is publicly traded (NYSE: WMT), sensitive to ESG ratings, institutional investors control majority of shares

**Actions**:
1. **Shareholder resolutions** demanding:
   - Annual animal welfare reporting (aligned with BBFAW framework)
   - Time-bound commitments on cage-free eggs, BCC chickens, crate-free pork
   - Public disclosure of antibiotic use in supply chain
   
2. **ESG rating campaigns**: Coordinate with MSCI, Sustainalytics to downgrade Walmart on animal welfare
   
3. **Institutional investor engagement**: Target BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street (combined own 20%+ of Walmart) to vote for welfare resolutions

**Evidence**: Starbucks, McDonald's, Unilever all moved on animal welfare after shareholder pressure

### B. Brand Reputation / Consumer Campaigns
**Why It Works**: Walmart's brand is "Save Money, Live Better" - vulnerable to "cruelty at low prices" counter-narrative

**Actions**:
1. **Social media campaigns**:
   - #WalmartCruelty targeting Instagram, TikTok (younger demographic cares about this)
   - User-generated content: "Shop with your values" comparing Walmart (D grade) to Whole Foods (A grade)
   
2. **Influencer partnerships**: Partner with food/lifestyle influencers to promote ASPCA Scorecard, drive traffic to competitors
   
3. **Store actions**: 
   - Peaceful demonstrations at high-traffic Walmart stores
   - "Cage-free egg hunts" - activists searching for cage-free options in stores, documenting scarcity
   
4. **Celebrity endorsements**: Leverage celebrity animal advocates (Joaquin Phoenix, Billie Eilish, etc.) to call out Walmart specifically

**Risk**: Consumer boycotts are hard to sustain, but brand damage is cumulative

### C. Supply Chain Pressure (Indirect Route)
**Why It Works**: Major suppliers (Tyson, Cal-Maine Foods) are already under pressure from other retailers

**Actions**:
1. **Amplify supplier commitments**: 
   - If Tyson commits to BCC for McDonald's/Subway, pressure them to extend to Walmart
   - Create "supplier scorecard" showing which companies sell welfare-certified to Costco but not Walmart
   
2. **Buyer coordination**: If multiple major retailers (Kroger, Albertsons, Target) accelerate BCC implementation, Walmart faces supply chain reality where welfare-certified becomes default

**Evidence**: When Unilever, Nestlé, and Mars committed to cage-free eggs, it created market tipping point

### D. Regulatory/Policy Advocacy (Long-term)
**Why It Works**: Walmart lobbies heavily on food policy; can be pressured to support (or not oppose) animal welfare legislation

**Actions**:
1. **State-level bans**: Support CA, MA, OR, WA efforts to ban extreme confinement
   - If enough states pass laws, Walmart must comply regionally, making national policy cheaper
   
2. **Federal action**: Advocate for USDA organic standards to include meaningful animal welfare (Walmart sells organic products)
   
3. **Trade policy**: Pressure for animal welfare in trade agreements (Walmart imports food globally)

**Evidence**: California Prop 12 (banning crates/cages) forced nationwide supply chain changes

### E. Media Amplification
**Why It Works**: Walmart is media-sensitive, especially around labor/ethics issues

**Actions**:
1. **Investigative journalism**: Partner with outlets (NYT, Washington Post, Guardian) for exposés:
   - "Walmart's Hidden Cruelty: Inside the Factory Farms Feeding America's Largest Retailer"
   - Undercover footage from Walmart suppliers showing extreme confinement
   
2. **Earned media**: Strategically release ASPCA Scorecard updates, protests, shareholder resolutions to generate news cycles
   
3. **Comparison framing**: "Whole Foods Gets an A on Animal Welfare. Walmart Gets a D. Here's Why."

**Evidence**: McDonald's moved on BCC after sustained media pressure including undercover investigations

---

## 6. SPECIFIC GAPS TO EXPLOIT

### A. Walmart's Own Stated Values (Hypocrisy Angle)
From Walmart's corporate site:
- **"Live Better"**: How is extreme animal suffering compatible with this?
- **Sustainability leadership**: Project Gigaton targets climate change; factory farming is a major climate driver
- **Community health**: Overuse of antibiotics in factory farms contributes to antibiotic resistance (public health crisis)

**Campaign Frame**: "Walmart: Leading on Climate, Failing on Cruelty"

### B. Competitive Disadvantage
- **Whole Foods** (owned by Amazon): A grade, gaining market share among conscious consumers
- **Costco**: C grade, still ahead of Walmart
- **Kroger**: C grade, more progress on chicken welfare

**Campaign Frame**: "Why Does Walmart Lag Behind Costco and Kroger on Animal Welfare?"

### C. Store Brand Opportunity
- **Sam's Club** already has 100% cage-free store brand eggs
- **Great Value** (Walmart brand) could immediately source BCC chicken, crate-free pork

**Campaign Frame**: "Sam's Club Shows It's Possible. Why Won't Walmart Do It?"

---

## 7. RECOMMENDED PRESSURE STRATEGY (Sequenced)

### Phase 1: Build Coalition & Evidence (Months 1-3)
1. **Coordinate with major animal welfare orgs**: ASPCA, Humane League, Mercy For Animals, HSUS, World Animal Protection
2. **Gather undercover footage**: Document conditions at Walmart suppliers (Tyson, Perdue, Cal-Maine Foods facilities)
3. **Shareholder resolution prep**: File resolution for 2027 proxy season (deadline typically Nov 2026)
4. **Influencer outreach**: Recruit 20+ food/lifestyle influencers to promote ASPCA Scorecard

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Months 4-6)
1. **Media blitz**: Coordinate NYT/Guardian investigative pieces, release undercover footage
2. **Social media campaign**: #WalmartCruelty, #ShopWithYourHeart (ASPCA's existing hashtag)
3. **Store actions**: Peaceful protests at 50+ high-traffic Walmart stores nationwide
4. **Investor engagement**: Meet with BlackRock, Vanguard ESG teams

### Phase 3: Escalate Pressure (Months 7-12)
1. **Shareholder vote**: Push resolution to 20%+ support (signals mainstream investor concern)
2. **Celebrity endorsements**: High-profile figures call out Walmart specifically
3. **Competitive comparison ads**: "Whole Foods: A. Costco: C. Walmart: D. Shop Your Values."
4. **Supplier pressure**: If Tyson/Perdue commit to BCC elsewhere, demand Walmart extension

### Phase 4: Negotiate & Lock In (Months 12-18)
1. **Direct negotiation**: With John Laney (EVP Food) and John Furner (CEO)
2. **Incremental commitments**: 
   - Start with cage-free eggs completion by 2026
   - BCC commitment by 2030 (industry standard timeline)
   - Crate-free pork by 2028
3. **Third-party verification**: Demand annual reporting to BBFAW or ASPCA
4. **Store brand pilot**: Launch BCC Great Value chicken in 100 stores, expand based on sales

---

## 8. RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Walmart Ignores Pressure
**Likelihood**: High (they've ignored advocates for years)
**Mitigation**: 
- Sustained, escalating campaigns (don't give up after 6 months)
- Investor pressure is hardest to ignore (ESG ratings affect cost of capital)
- Supply chain reality: if competitors move, Walmart will face higher costs for non-welfare-certified products

### Risk 2: Greenwashing (Fake Commitments)
**Likelihood**: Medium (common corporate tactic)
**Mitigation**:
- Demand specific, measurable commitments (not "exploring" or "committed to continuous improvement")
- Third-party auditing required
- Annual progress reporting with consequences for missing deadlines
- Learn from BCC model: specific breed names, stocking densities, lighting standards

### Risk 3: Cost Pass-Through (Walmart Claims It's Too Expensive)
**Likelihood**: High (will definitely claim this)
**Mitigation**:
- Costco, Whole Foods already prove higher welfare is feasible
- Studies show BCC increases costs by ~1% (imperceptible to consumers)
- Walmart's scale creates purchasing power to absorb costs
- Frame as long-term risk mitigation (antibiotic resistance, pandemic prevention, brand damage)

### Risk 4: Supplier Resistance
**Likelihood**: High (Tyson, Cal-Maine Foods will push back)
**Mitigation**:
- Many suppliers already producing welfare-certified for other retailers
- Walmart's scale means suppliers can't afford to lose them
- Create market reality: if Kroger, Albertsons, Costco all demand BCC, suppliers must adapt

## 11. CONCLUSION

**Walmart represents the single highest-leverage target for farm animal welfare advocacy in the United States.**

With 25% of the grocery market and global supply chain dominance, a Walmart commitment to:
- Cage-free eggs
- Better Chicken Commitment  
- Gestation crate-free pork

...would force systemic change across the meat, egg, and dairy industries.

**Current Status**: Walmart is failing (D grade, 221/900). They have zero meaningful policies on chickens or pigs, and slow progress on cage-free eggs despite having a commitment.

**Why They'll Move**: 
1. **Investor pressure** (ESG ratings, shareholder resolutions)
2. **Competitive disadvantage** (Whole Foods, Costco ahead)
3. **Brand reputation risk** (Gen Z consumers demand ethical sourcing)
4. **Supply chain reality** (if competitors move, non-welfare-certified becomes more expensive)

**Strategic Approach**: 
- Coordinate major orgs (ASPCA, Humane League, HSUS, MFA)
- Investor-focused pressure (hardest to ignore)
- Media amplification (investigative journalism, undercover footage)
- Sustained escalation (12-24 month campaign, not one-off)
- Exploit gaps (store brand pilot, competitive framing, hypocrisy on sustainability)

**Target Timeline**:
- **2026**: Cage-free eggs completion, shareholder resolution
- **2027-2028**: BCC pilot in Great Value, gestation crate commitment
- **2030**: Full Better Chicken Commitment implementation across Walmart supply chain

**If successful**, this could be a watershed moment comparable to McDonald's cage-free egg commitment - proving that even the most cost-sensitive, massive-scale retailer can prioritize animal welfare.

## APPENDIX: Better Chicken Commitment (Full Policy)

Companies adopting the BCC commit to require suppliers to meet these standards for 100% of chicken products:

1. **Breed**: Use only BCC-approved breeds demonstrating higher welfare outcomes
   - Hubbard JA757, JACY57, JA787, JA957, JA987, JACY87, REDBRO, RedbroM, Norfolk Black
   - Aviagen Rowan Ranger, Rambler Ranger, Ranger Classic, Ranger Premium, Ranger Gold, Rustic Gold, Freedom Ranger
   - Cobb-Sasso 200 (CS200), Cooks Venture Pioneer, Royal Gray Broiler
   - Or breeds passing RSPCA/GAP welfare assessments

2. **Housing**: 
   - Maximum stocking density: 6.0 lbs/sq foot (prohibit all cages)
   - At least 3 inches friable litter covering whole floor
   - Minimum 8 hours continuous light (≥50 lux) + 6 hours continuous darkness daily (≤5 lux)
   - Enrichments: perches, strawbales, or platforms for all birds

3. **Slaughter**: 
   - Multi-step controlled-atmosphere processing (avoids live shackling/stunning)
   - Induces irreversible stun before slaughter

4. **Verification**:
   - Third-party auditing
   - Annual public progress reporting

**Implementation Timeline**: Typically 3-7 years based on supply chain size (Walmart would likely need 6-7 years = 2030 target)

**Cost Impact**: Studies show BCC increases costs by ~1% (approximately $0.05-0.10 per pound of chicken)

**Companies with BCC Commitments**: Whole Foods, Panera, Chipotle, Shake Shack, Subway, Burger King, Starbucks (200+ companies globally)

**Walmart's Current Status**: ZERO progress. Not even acknowledged.
