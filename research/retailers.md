# Major Food Retailer Animal Welfare Research
## Costco, Kroger, Albertsons - Strategic Pressure Analysis

**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Purpose:** Identify strategic leverage points for animal welfare campaigns targeting major food retailers

---

## Executive Summary

Based on ASPCA's 2024 Supermarket Scorecard and available research, these three retailers represent critical pressure points in the US food system. All three have SOME animal welfare policies but significant gaps compared to industry leaders and competitors like Walmart.

**Key Finding:** All three retailers lag significantly behind on chicken welfare (Better Chicken Commitment) while making varied progress on cage-free eggs and gestation crates.

## 1. COSTCO WHOLESALE

### Company Profile
- **HQ:** Issaquah, Washington
- **CEO:** Ron Vachris (President & CEO, started as forklift driver in 1982)
- **Chairman:** Hamilton E. James
- **Size:** 923 warehouses worldwide (633 in US), 341,000 employees
- **Revenue:** $275.2 billion (2025)
- **Members:** 145.2 million (2025)
- **Rank:** #12 on Fortune 500, 3rd largest retailer globally
- **Market Position:** World's largest retailer of beef, poultry, organic produce, and wine
- **Ownership:** 70%+ institutional (Vanguard 9.4%, BlackRock 7.56%, State Street 4.06%)

### Current Animal Welfare Scorecard (ASPCA 2024)

**Overall Score:** 375/900 (Grade C)
- **Broiler Chickens:** 25/300
  - Policy: 25/100 (mentions issue only)
  - Progress: 0/100
  - Store Brand: 0/100
- **Egg-Laying Hens:** 267/300
  - Policy: 75/100 (partial commitment)
  - Progress: 91.6/100 (strong progress)
  - Store Brand: 100/100 (ALL Costco store brand eggs are cage-free)
- **Pregnant Pigs:** 83/300
  - Policy: 0/100 (no policy)
  - Progress: 0/100
  - Store Brand: 83/100

### Strengths
- **Cage-Free Eggs:** ALL store brand eggs are cage-free (100% compliance) - leading the industry
- December 2020 commitment to eliminate battery cages globally (first US retailer with global policy)
- Strong progress reporting on egg transition (91.6%)
- Massive purchasing power as world's largest poultry retailer

### Critical Gaps
- **NO Better Chicken Commitment** - only "mentions issue"
- **NO gestation crate policy** despite 2012 MFA investigation leading to initial commitment
- Operates own vertically-integrated chicken facility in Nebraska (opened 2019) - controls supply chain but uses fast-growing breeds
- Sells 137+ million rotisserie chickens annually at $4.99 (iconic loss leader)

### Recent Controversies
- **Feb 2021:** Mercy for Animals undercover investigation showed chickens unable to move, covered in chemical burns at Nebraska facility
- **June 2022:** Shareholder lawsuit by Legal Impact for Chickens alleging breach of fiduciary duty for using fast-growing breeds that violate animal welfare laws in Nebraska and Iowa
- **Feb 2021 NYT Op-Ed:** Nicholas Kristof: "The Ugly Secrets Behind the Costco Chicken" - accused Costco of breeding chickens "to suffer"

### Strategic Leverage Points

**Supply Chain Control:**
- Costco vertically integrated chicken production = full control but also full responsibility
- Can implement Better Chicken Commitment without supplier negotiation barriers
- Nebraska facility could become MODEL for better practices or remain symbol of industrial cruelty

**Brand Reputation:**
- Strong customer loyalty (90%+ employee retention, 145M members)
- "Treasure hunt" shopping experience relies on trust
- $4.99 chicken is iconic - but vulnerable to ethical scrutiny

**Decision-Makers:**
- CEO Ron Vachris: Started as forklift driver, promoted from within - culture of listening to front-line workers
- Issaquah HQ: All 7000 employees (including CEO) sit in cubicles - egalitarian culture
- CEO visits warehouses globally every 18-24 months - accessible

**Investor Pressure:**
- 70%+ institutional ownership (Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street)
- 2022 shareholder lawsuit precedent
- ESG-focused investors increasingly scrutinizing animal welfare

**Media Amplification:**
- Previous media coverage (NYT, CNN) generated significant pressure
- Celebrity advocacy (Brad Pitt 2015 cage-free campaign succeeded)
- Rotisserie chicken is cultural icon - any story about it goes viral

## 2. KROGER

### Company Profile
- **HQ:** Cincinnati, Ohio
- **Size:** Multiple banner chains (Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, etc.)
- **Market Position:** Largest pure-play grocery chain in US
- **Store Brands:** Simple Truth, Private Selection, etc.

### Current Animal Welfare Scorecard (ASPCA 2024)

**Overall Score:** 321/900 (Grade C)
- **Broiler Chickens:** 57.85/300
  - Policy: 50/100 (partial - 2 of 4 components)

- **Pregnant Pigs:** 113/300
  - Policy: 0/100 (no complete policy)
  - Progress: 0/100 (NOT REPORTING - major transparency gap)
  - Store Brand: 113/100

### Strengths
- Simple Truth + Kipster eggs (Certified Humane with unique transparency)
- Some higher-welfare pork options in store brands
- Partial chicken policy (addresses some BCC components)

### Critical Gaps
- **Chicken progress SLOWED from 2023** despite having partial policy
- **NO complete cage-free egg policy** despite industry movement
- **NOT REPORTING progress on gestation crates** - major red flag
- Lower store brand compliance than competitors

### Strategic Leverage Points
- Large market share = high impact potential
- Multiple banner stores = opportunity for differentiation or unified pressure

## 3. ALBERTSONS / SAFEWAY

### Company Profile
- **Note:** Albertsons and Safeway scored IDENTICALLY (both part of Albertsons Companies)
- **HQ:** Boise, Idaho
- **Market Position:** 2nd largest pure-play grocery chain in US

### Critical Gaps
- **Chicken progress SLOWED from 2023** despite partial policy
- Weak pork policy and implementation
- NO fully crate-free store brand pork options

---

## COMPETITIVE BENCHMARK: WALMART

### Walmart Scorecard (ASPCA 2024)
**Overall Score:** 221/900 (Grade D) - LOWER than all three targets

- Chickens: 0/300 (no policy, no progress, no compliant store brands)
- Eggs: 196/300 (partial progress)
- Pigs: 25/300 (minimal)

**Key Insight:** Walmart is WORSE than Costco/Kroger/Albertsons on paper, but has massive market power. Using Walmart as "floor" baseline helps pressure others to lead.

---

## GAP ANALYSIS vs. INDUSTRY LEADERS

### Best Performers (ASPCA 2024)
1. **Whole Foods Market:** 761/900 (A grade)
   - Only supermarket with BCC-certified chicken product
   - Complete policies across all three categories
   - Store brands fully compliant

2. **Sprouts Farmers Market:** 494/900 (B grade)
   - First to report on breed progress
   - 100% cage-free store brand eggs
   - Strong across all categories

---

## RECOMMENDED PRESSURE STRATEGIES

### 1. **Costco-Specific Tactics**

**Primary Ask:** Adopt Better Chicken Commitment at Nebraska facility
- You control the supply chain - no excuses
- Your $4.99 chicken shouldn't mean suffering
- Follow Whole Foods' lead (they're Kroger competitor, you can do better)

**Secondary Ask:** Complete and report on gestation crate elimination
- You committed in 2012 after MFA investigation
- Other retailers are reporting progress - why aren't you?

**Leverage Points:**
- **Shareholder activism:** Build on 2022 lawsuit precedent, engage ESG-focused institutional investors (Vanguard, BlackRock)
- **Member campaigns:** 145M members = massive grassroots base, "I love Costco but..." narrative
- **Media amplification:** Rotisserie chicken is iconic, celebrity advocates (past success with Brad Pitt), Nicholas Kristof-style investigative journalism
- **Supply chain transparency:** Nebraska facility visit requests, FOIA for inspection reports

### 2. **Kroger-Specific Tactics**

**Primary Ask:** Complete cage-free egg policy with timeline
- You're behind Albertsons and Walmart on policy strength
- Simple Truth brand should mean better standards

**Secondary Ask:** REPORT progress on gestation crates
- You're the only major retailer NOT reporting
- Transparency gap = credibility gap

**Leverage Points:**
- **Transparency campaign:** "Where's the data, Kroger?" - focus on reporting gap
- **Investor pressure:** Proposed Kroger/Albertsons merger creates scrutiny moment
- **State-level pressure:** California/Massachusetts stores already comply with state laws - why not nationwide?

### 3. **Albertsons/Safeway-Specific Tactics**

**Primary Ask:** Accelerate chicken welfare progress (currently slowing)
- You have partial policy but progress is DECLINING
- What's the implementation barrier?

**Secondary Ask:** Complete gestation crate policy with full store brand compliance

**Leverage Points:**
- **Merger scrutiny:** Kroger acquisition attempt = regulatory/public attention window
- **O Organics brand positioning:** Premium brand should lead on welfare
- **Regional pressure:** Different banners = targeted local campaigns

---

## PRESSURE COORDINATION STRATEGY

### Why Target All Three Simultaneously?

1. **Supply chain leverage:** All three buy from same major suppliers (Tyson, JBS, Perdue). Coordinated pressure = supplier-level change.

2. **Competitive dynamics:** "Walmart is terrible, but YOU claimed to be better - prove it" + "Whole Foods/Sprouts are doing it - why can't you?"

3. **Media efficiency:** "Major grocery chains lag on animal welfare" story is bigger than single retailer.

4. **Regulatory momentum:** California/Massachusetts cage bans, potential federal pressure - position these retailers as either leaders or laggards.

### Tactical Sequence

**Phase 1: Research & Coalition (Months 1-2)**
- Document specific product sourcing (which chicken brands, egg suppliers, pork suppliers)
- Build coalition with Mercy for Animals, HSUS, The Humane League, Animal Equality
- Identify sympathetic institutional investors at each company

**Phase 2: Quiet Engagement (Months 3-4)**
- Private meetings with corporate responsibility teams
- Present business case (consumer demand, competitive positioning, supply chain risk)
- Set 90-day response deadline

**Phase 3: Public Escalation (Months 5-6)**
- Coordinated shareholder resolutions (AGM season)
- Media investigations (undercover footage if available, supply chain exposés)
- Celebrity/influencer campaigns
- Member/customer petitions

**Phase 4: Sustained Pressure (Months 7-12)**
- Weekly actions at flagship stores
- Social media campaigns highlighting specific products
- Investor briefings on ESG risks
- Regulatory advocacy (support state-level cage/crate bans)

## DECISION-MAKER INTELLIGENCE

### Costco
- **CEO Ron Vachris:** Lifelong Costco employee, promoted from within, culture of warehouse focus
- **Board:** Hamilton E. James (Chairman), institutional board
- **Accessibility:** CEO visits stores regularly, HQ culture is egalitarian (cubicles for everyone)
- **Prior responsiveness:** Responded to Brad Pitt cage-free campaign (2015), but resisted BCC pressure

### Kroger
- **CEO:** [Need current CEO name - check investor relations]
- **Board:** [Need board composition]
- **Pending merger:** Kroger/Albertsons deal creates unique pressure window

### Albertsons
- **CEO:** [Need current CEO name]
- **Board:** [Need board composition]
- **Ownership:** Private equity history = financial performance pressure

---

## MEDIA & NARRATIVE STRATEGIES

### Key Messages

**For Costco:**
- "America's favorite warehouse sells rotisserie chickens bred to suffer"
- "Costco controls its chicken supply chain - and chooses cruelty"
- "145 million members deserve better than this"

**For Kroger:**
- "Kroger hides behind 'Simple Truth' while hiding the truth about animal welfare"
- "America's largest grocer refuses to report on animal welfare progress"
- "Your competitors are leading - why are you lagging?"

**For Albertsons:**
- "Your animal welfare progress is going backward"
- "O Organics should mean organic values - not organic suffering"

### Media Targets
- **Investigative:** NYT, Washington Post, Guardian (past coverage of animal welfare)
- **Business:** Bloomberg, WSJ, Fortune (ESG/investor angle)
- **Food:** Food & Wine, Epicurious, Bon Appetit (consumer education)
- **Activist:** Vox, Mother Jones, The Intercept (deeper investigations)

### Celebrity/Influencer Strategy
- Prior success with Brad Pitt (Costco eggs) and Ryan Gosling
- Target: Food influencers with large followings, ethical consumption advocates
- Approach: "I love shopping at X, but did you know..."

---

## SUPPLY CHAIN PRESSURE POINTS

### Shared Suppliers (All Three Retailers)
- **Tyson Foods:** Major chicken supplier
- **JBS:** Beef and pork
- **Cargill:** Multiple proteins
- **Perdue:** Chicken (some stores)

**Coordinated Strategy:** Pressure retailers + suppliers simultaneously. If Tyson commits to BCC for one retailer, leverage for others.

### Certification Bodies
- **Certified Humane**
- **Global Animal Partnership**
- **Better Chicken Project**

Work with certifiers to make transition easier for retailers (remove "it's too hard" excuse).

---

## MEASUREMENT & SUCCESS METRICS

### Short-term (6 months)
- Public commitment to complete policies (BCC, cage-free, crate-free)
- Initiation of progress reporting (especially Kroger on pork)
- Pilot programs at flagship stores

### Medium-term (1-2 years)
- 25%+ of store brand products meeting higher welfare standards
- Annual progress reports published
- Supply chain audits completed

### Long-term (3-5 years)
- 100% compliance with Better Chicken Commitment
- 100% cage-free eggs (all products, not just store brands)
- 100% gestation crate-free pork

---

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Cost increase pushback
**Mitigation:** Emphasize supply chain efficiency gains, consumer willingness to pay, competitive positioning

### Risk 2: Supplier resistance
**Mitigation:** Coordinate with other retailers for collective purchasing power, work with suppliers on transition timelines

### Risk 3: Consumer confusion
**Mitigation:** Clear labeling, education campaigns, partner with trusted third-party certifiers

### Risk 4: Greenwashing
**Mitigation:** Demand third-party audits, annual public reporting, specific timelines with milestones

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Verify and update decision-maker information** (current CEOs, board members, sustainability officers)
2. **Conduct supply chain mapping** (which suppliers, which facilities, which products)
3. **Build retailer-specific dossiers** (past controversies, commitments, broken promises)
4. **Convene coalition partners** (MFA, HSUS, THL, Animal Equality, etc.)
5. **Develop investor briefing materials** (ESG risks, competitive analysis, business case)
6. **Prepare media pitches** (investigative story angles, data visualization, human interest angles)
7. **Design member/customer engagement strategy** (petitions, store actions, social media campaigns)
